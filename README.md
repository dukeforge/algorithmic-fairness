# algorithmic-fairness
A tour guide through some of the publicly available algorithmic fairness tools out there (Google's What If, IBM's Fairness 360, and Aequitas)


For Google’s What if Tool, see https://pair-code.github.io/what-if-tool/#demo-panel-all

For IBM’s Fairness 360, see http://aif360.mybluemix.net/data 

For Aequitas, see http://aequitas.dssg.io 

To properly test these tools, we'll be using the COMPAS dataset for evaluation, since these three tools all share walkthroughs for this dataset.
